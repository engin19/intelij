Encapsulation:
    for every entity that you are going to have in java create a separate class
     and use it when you need it .
     it helps us write more secure and manageable code.


     Collections Framework;  is simply a collection of classes which helps us manage and manipulate large
     amount of data.


     why do we need Collection Framework?
     1) we cant use arrays as they are fixed in size.
     2) Arrays don't have built-in methods

     Both of those problems solved with collection framework;


     ArrayList:




     framework lots of classes put together that has lots of methods in it to build something easily.
