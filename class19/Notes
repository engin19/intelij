Type casting in object;
Converting the datatype of data . There are two types of type casting upcasting and
down-casting.


PolyMorphism in Java:
1) compile Time;(Static Binding/ Early Binding)
achieved through method overloading
2) RunTime (dynamic/Late Biding)
achieved thru overriding.
SAme object behaves differently
same method different objects
when you are calling the same method  polymorphism allows us to
write the same code to the parent class( since those classes are related,)
we can create an array and call the same method with loop and save a lot of repetition

when your classes are related and there is a inheritance you use abstract,
if the classes are not related then you use interface.
