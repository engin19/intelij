Collections Framework:
    Collection Framework is simply a collection of classes and interfaces which help us
    store the data easily. The classes in this framework are dynamic and have a lot of built-in
    methods that we can use to manipulate the data.

    There are 3 main chatogories we have.

   Main interfaces;
   1) List
   2) Set
   3) Map


   1) List:
   * List can store duplicate data.
   * They remember the order in which you insert the data

   There are two main classes which implement the list interface.
   ArrayList and LinkedList

   nserting->LinkedList, accessing->ArrayList is easier.
   ArrayList internally uses an array which makes the accessing the elements fast but
   adding or removing an element is supper slow in arraylist.
   On the other hand  LinkedList  uses a doublelly LinkedList internally, so inserting or removing elements
   from Linked list is really easy but accessing the elements is really slow.

   Sets:
    The sets don't allow duplicate elements.
    There are 3 major types of sets
    1) HashSet: HashSet are really fast but they don't remember the order which we insert the elements.

    2) LinkedHashSet:
                Pro: They remember the insertation order.
                Cons: They are little slower as compared the Hashset.

    3) TreeSet:
            Pro:They always keep the data sorted.
            Cons: insertion is very slow

   Maps:
   Maps allows us to store the data in pairs. (key,value)
   There are so many classes  but we are going to discuss only 3 main types of maps.

   1) Hashmap:HashMap are really fast but they don't remember the order which we insert the elements.
   2) LinkedHasMap:
                Pro: They remember the insertation order.
                Cons: They are little slower as compared the Hashset.
   3) TreeMap:
                 Pro:They always keep the data sorted.
                 Cons: insertion is very slow

Map and Sets dont supports index based loops but we can use enhanced loop.

Files Handling :  DEaling with files Reading/Writing/Copying/Moving files using programing.
________________
1)  Location of the File
2)  Navigate to the location/bring the file to the RAM.
3)  Software/class that knows how to read/write  data to that file.

Configuration Files:
    configuration files are sued to store sensitive configuration related information.
    Like URLS username,password ect.
