Interface;
interfaces are contracts.
They are used to make sure that every programmer is on the same page
they use abstraction for this purpose
by default they are abstract and abstract methods don't have body.

Encapsulation;
Encapsulation  means put everything related into one class.
Encapsulation says create a class for every entity and define methods related to that
class instead of putting everything inside the method.
it also says make your fields private and define GETTER and SETTER methods for those fields.
