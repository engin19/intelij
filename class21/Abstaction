Abstraction in Java :
Abstract means something which is not clear or not complete.
we use Abstraction to create methods which are not complete meaning they dont have a body
they have only method headers.
Why  should we create abstract method?
1)when we know that every child will be overriding a method we dont need
to have a method body.
2)it acts as a template when we create a method as an abstract
EVERY CHILD MUST PROVIDE A BODY FOR THAT METHOD.
IT IS USED TO ENFORCE ON THE CHILD CLASSES.


whenever we have an abstract class we cant create an object class.  we have to
create a child class implement from parents class and then create an object.



cant be private and abstract
final and abstract cant be used together
THERE IS NO ABSTRACT FIELDS( THERE IS NOT SUCH A THING)
even though you can not create an object of an abstract class but you can
have a constructor to reach instance variable.


Interfaces: something which is common in two systems. it is like a contract
that helps us know what type of methods should be present in a class for that class to be albe to work
