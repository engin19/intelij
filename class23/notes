LinkedList:


Set:
Sets are very similar to lis bur they do not allow duplicates and they ignore duplicates
 and they print randomly.

 HashSet;
 upside: very fast
 downside: they do not store the data in order.

 LinkedHAshSet:
 upside: It remembers the order.
 downside: it is slower than HashSet

 TreeSet: Duplicates are going to be ignored again just like in any sets
 Upside: it keeps the data sorted always.
 downside: inserting new element is very slow.
