/*there are 3 types of variable types
 1)Local variable;
 if there is a code inside of a block of a code it is local variable.
 local variables  limited in scoop access/visibillitiy/accesibility
 you can only access inside of the same block they are in created.
 when should i create a local variable :
 when we need to store data temporary
 when I am sure I am not using it for other methods but only this one, I create local

 whenever you are plannig to reuse a variable in more than
 two methods of your class create an instance variable for that

 whenever i m writing any logic in a method or loop or if condition and
  i need to temporarily need to store some data then we should create local variables.
  Static variable:
  when do you use static
    whenever we want to store  something that is  universal (constants) and it doesnt usually change we
    can safely go and create a static variable for that.
