PolyMorphism;
it is a mechanism in JAVA that allows methods to behave differently
depending upon which object are using to call them.
there are two types of polymorphism dynamic and static.

1) Dynamic Polymorphism; is achieved through method overriding.
2) Static Polymorphism; is achieved through method overloading.


why do we use the Polymorphism (What is the benefit of Polymorphism ;
it allows us to avoid code repetition.
if we have to call multiple methods from multiple classes and they are all sibling classes

What do we need to apply PolyMorphism;
1) inheritance
2) Method overRiding
3) TypeCasting
4) loops
5) Arrays

Interfaces; something which is act as a common ground.
are like contracts which makes sure that everybody is on the same page..
they achieve this thru abstraction..

  1) inside an interface by default every method is public and abstract.
  2) there are no instance variables inside the interfaces.
  3) you cant have a constructors inside the interface
  4) you cant create an object of interfaces
  5) if you want you can have static methods but they will be always final.( by Default)
     by default every variable public static and final.
